# Multiple Payment Methods Feature

## üìã Overview

Protega CloudPay now supports multiple payment methods per user! Users can add multiple cards and select which one to use at payment time. This feature maintains full PCI compliance through Stripe tokenization.

---

## üéØ What's New

### 1. Multiple Cards Per User
- Users can now store multiple payment methods (credit/debit cards)
- Each payment method includes: brand, last4, expiration date
- One payment method can be set as default
- All stored securely via Stripe

### 2. Card Selection at Payment
- Choose specific card during payment
- Falls back to default if no card specified
- Terminal displays available cards for selection

### 3. Payment Method Management
- List all payment methods for a user
- Add new payment methods
- Set/change default payment method
- Delete payment methods (must keep at least one)

---

## üîß Database Changes

### Updated `payment_methods` Table
```sql
- exp_month (INTEGER) - Card expiration month
- exp_year (INTEGER) - Card expiration year
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP) - Last update timestamp
- provider_payment_method_id (UNIQUE INDEX) - Prevents duplicates
```

### Migration Applied
‚úÖ Migration `002_add_payment_method_fields` has been applied automatically

---

## üîí Security Features

### Stripe Tokenization
- Raw card details never stored in our database
- Only Stripe payment method IDs stored
- PCI DSS compliant

### Biometric Authentication
- All payments require fingerprint match
- PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 hashing (200,000 iterations)
- Raw biometric data never stored

### Payment Method Validation
- Cards must belong to the authenticated user
- Cannot delete last remaining payment method
- Stripe validates all payment method tokens
