## üöÄ Let's Begin!

### STEP 1: Create Merchant Account

**Option A: Via API Docs (Recommended)**

1. Open: http://localhost:8000/docs
2. Find: `POST /merchant/signup`
3. Click "Try it out"
4. Use this payload:

```json

  "email": "demo@protega.com",
  "password": "demo1234"
}
```

5. Click "Execute"
6. **SAVE THE RESPONSE:**
   - `terminal_api_key` (e.g., TERMINAL-xxx)

   - `email`

**Option B: Via cURL**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/merchant/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Demo Coffee Shop",
    "email": "demo@protega.com",
    "password": "demo1234"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**

}
```

‚úÖ **Save your `terminal_api_key` - you'll need it for payments!**

---

### STEP 2: Login to Merchant Dashboard

2. Enter credentials:
   - Email: `demo@protega.com`
   - Password: `demo1234`

3. Click "Enroll Now"

**Expected Success Screen:**
```
‚úÖ Enrollment Successful!

Enrolled Email: u***@example.com

```

‚úÖ **Note the user is enrolled with Visa as default card**

### STEP 4: Add Second Payment Method (Mastercard)

**Via Merchant Dashboard:**

1. Go back to: http://localhost:3000/merchant/dashboard
2. Find "Quick Actions" panel
3. Enter User ID: `1` (this is the first enrolled user)
4. Click "Manage Payment Methods"
5. You should see: http://localhost:3000/merchant/customers/1/methods

**Current State:**

```

**Add Mastercard:**

   Mastercard ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 5555  12/25  [Set Default] [Remove]
```

‚úÖ **User now has 2 payment methods!**

---

### STEP 5: Test Payment with Default Card (Visa)

1. Open: http://localhost:3000/kiosk
2. Enter:
   - Terminal API Key: `[paste your terminal_api_key from Step 1]`
   - Fingerprint Sample: `DEMO-FINGER-001`
   - Amount (in cents): `1500` (= $15.00)
   - Payment Method ID: **leave empty** (will use default)
3. Click "üí≥ Process Payment"

**Expected Success:**
```
‚úÖ Transaction Approved

Transaction ID: 1
Amount Charged: $15.00
```

**Verify in Dashboard:**
1. Go back to merchant dashboard
2. Check "Recent Transactions" table
3. You should see the $15.00 transaction

‚úÖ **Payment processed with default Visa card**

---

### STEP 6: Change Default to Mastercard

1. Go back to: http://localhost:3000/merchant/customers/1/methods
2. Click "Set Default" button on Mastercard
3. Toast notification: "Mastercard ending in 5555 set as default"

---

### STEP 7: Test Payment with New Default (Mastercard)

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/kiosk
2. Enter:
   - Terminal API Key: `[your key]`
   - Fingerprint Sample: `DEMO-FINGER-001`
   - Amount: `2500` (= $25.00)
   - Payment Method ID: **leave empty**
3. Click "üí≥ Process Payment"

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Payment processes successfully
- ‚úÖ Uses Mastercard (the new default)
- ‚úÖ New transaction appears in dashboard

---

### STEP 8: Test Payment with Specific Card (Force Visa)

Now let's manually choose which card to use!

**Get Visa Payment Method ID:**
1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/merchant/customers/1/methods
2. Look at the Visa card - you need its Stripe ID

**Option A: Get via API**
```bash
# First, get your merchant JWT token from browser:
# Open browser DevTools > Application > Local Storage > protega_merchant_token

curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/users/1/payment-methods \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "provider_payment_method_id": "pm_xxx...",  ‚Üê COPY THIS
      "brand": "visa",
      "last4": "4242"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "provider_payment_method_id": "pm_yyy...",
      "brand": "mastercard",
      "last4": "5555"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Process Payment with Specific Card:**
1. Go to kiosk: http://localhost:3000/kiosk
2. Enter:
   - Terminal API Key: `[your key]`
   - Fingerprint Sample: `DEMO-FINGER-001`
   - Amount: `3000` (= $30.00)
   - **Payment Method ID: `[paste Visa's provider_payment_method_id]`**
3. Click "üí≥ Process Payment"

**Expected:**
- ‚úÖ Payment processes with Visa (even though Mastercard is default)
- ‚úÖ Success message shows which card was used

---

### STEP 9: Add Third Card (Amex)

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/merchant/customers/1/methods
2. Click "+ Add New Card"
3. Enter:
   - Token: `pm_card_amex`
   - Set as default: **checked** (make this the new default)
4. Click "Add Card"

**New State:**
```
‚úÖ Saved Cards
   Visa ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 4242  12/25  [Set Default] [Remove]
   Mastercard ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 5555  12/25  [Set Default] [Remove]
   Amex ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 1005  12/25  [Default]
```

‚úÖ **User now has 3 cards, Amex is default**

---

### STEP 10: Remove Old Card (Visa)

1. Stay on: http://localhost:3000/merchant/customers/1/methods
2. Click "Remove" on Visa card
3. Confirmation modal appears: "Are you sure you want to remove Visa ending in 4242?"
4. Click "Remove"
5. Toast: "Payment method removed successfully!"

**Final State:**
```
‚úÖ Saved Cards
   Mastercard ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 5555  12/25  [Set Default] [Remove]
   Amex ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ 1005  12/25  [Default]
```

‚úÖ **Visa removed, user has 2 cards remaining**

---

### STEP 11: Final Payment Test

**Test with new default (Amex):**
1. Go to kiosk
2. Process payment WITHOUT specifying card ID
3. Should charge Amex (the current default)

**Verify All Transactions:**
1. Go to merchant dashboard
2. Check "Recent Transactions"
3. You should see all your test payments
