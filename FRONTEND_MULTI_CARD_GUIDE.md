## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test Flow 1: Basic Multi-Card Enrollment

```bash
# Step 1: Create merchant account (via API docs)
POST /merchant/signup
{
  "name": "Test Merchant",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "password": "test1234"
}
# Save the terminal_api_key from response

# Step 2: Enroll user with first card
Navigate to http://localhost:3000/enroll
- Email: user@example.com
- Full Name: Test User
- Fingerprint: DEMO-FINGER-001
- Token: pm_card_visa
- ✓ Set as default payment method
- ✓ Consent checkbox
Submit → Note the user_id from success message

# Step 3: Add second card via merchant dashboard
Login at http://localhost:3000/merchant/login
Go to dashboard
Enter user_id in Quick Actions
Click "Manage Payment Methods"
Click "+ Add New Card"
- Token: pm_card_mastercard
- Leave "Set as default" unchecked
Add Card

# Step 4: View both cards
You should now see:
- Visa •••• 4242 (Default badge)
- Mastercard •••• 5555
```

### Test Flow 2: Payment with Specific Card

```bash
# Navigate to kiosk
http://localhost:3000/kiosk

# Enter payment details
- Terminal API Key: [from merchant signup]
- Fingerprint: DEMO-FINGER-001
- Amount: 2000 (= $20.00)

# Select specific card
- Scroll to "Payment Method Selection"
- Enter payment method ID (e.g., pm_xxx from methods page)
- OR leave empty to use default

# Process Payment
Click "Process Payment"
Success screen shows which card was charged
```

### Test Flow 3: Set Default & Remove Card

```bash
# Navigate to customer methods page
http://localhost:3000/merchant/customers/1/methods

# Set Mastercard as default
Click "Set Default" on Mastercard
→ Default badge moves to Mastercard
→ Stripe customer updated

# Test payment with new default
Go to kiosk
Process payment WITHOUT specifying card
→ Should charge Mastercard

# Remove old default (Visa)
Back to methods page
Click "Remove" on Visa
Confirm in modal
→ Card removed
→ Only Mastercard remains
```

### Test Tokens

Use these Stripe test tokens for testing:

```
pm_card_visa              → Visa ending in 4242
pm_card_mastercard        → Mastercard ending in 5555
pm_card_amex              → Amex ending in 1005
pm_card_discover          → Discover ending in 1117
pm_card_chargeDeclined    → Will fail (for testing error handling)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "User not found" when managing methods

**Solution:** Ensure the user ID exists. Check by enrolling a user first and noting the user_id from the success response.

### Issue: "Invalid authentication credentials"

**Solution:** 
1. Re-login to merchant dashboard
2. JWT token may have expired
3. Check browser console for token presence

### Issue: Card selection not showing at kiosk

**Solution:** 
1. Verify `ENABLE_CARD_SELECTION = true` in kiosk.tsx
2. Manually enter payment method ID for testing
3. Preview endpoint not yet implemented (expected)

### Issue: "Payment method already attached"

**Solution:** 
1. This token is already saved for this user
2. Use a different test token
3. Or remove the existing method first
