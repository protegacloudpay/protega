const response = await fetch('https://protega-api.fly.dev/enroll', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: customer.email,
    full_name: customer.name,
    fingerprint_sample: fingerprintScanner.read(),
    stripe_payment_method_token: stripeToken,
    consent_text: 'I consent to biometric storage'
  })
});

// Process payment via API
const payment = await fetch('https://protega-api.fly.dev/pay', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    terminal_api_key: YOUR_API_KEY,
    fingerprint_sample: fingerprintScanner.read(),
    amount_cents: 500,
    currency: 'usd'
  })
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Seamless customer experience
- Single POS interface
- Custom branding
- Full automation

**Cost:**
- DIY: Free (if you have a developer)
- Professional: $500-2000 (one-time)

## 🔄 How Card Reader Integration Works

### Universal Token System

**The magic:** Stripe payment method tokens

All major POS systems that use Stripe can generate payment tokens:

```
Customer swipes card on ANY POS
         ↓
POS generates Stripe payment method token
         ↓
Token sent to Protega (secure)
         ↓
Protega attaches token to customer
         ↓
Customer enrolled!
```

**What gets stored:**
- ❌ NOT stored: Card number
- ❌ NOT stored: CVV
- ❌ NOT stored: Full card data
- ✅ Stored: Secure Stripe token (e.g., `pm_abc123xyz`)

**Security:**
- PCI-DSS compliant (Level 1)
- Tokens can't be reversed to card numbers
- Encrypted in transit and at rest
- Same security as Apple Pay
