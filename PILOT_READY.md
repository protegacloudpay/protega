## 📊 Success Metrics

### Target Goals
```
✓ 95%+ transaction success rate
✓ 80%+ positive user feedback

✓ < 2 minutes average enrollment time
✓ Zero security incidents
✓ < 5 critical bugs
```

### How to Track
```bash
# Run status check anytime
./PILOT_STATUS_CHECK.sh

# Check transaction stats
docker exec protega-db psql -U protega -d protega -c "
  SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_transactions,
    SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'SUCCEEDED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as successful,
    ROUND(AVG(amount_cents)/100.0, 2) as avg_amount
  FROM transactions;
"

# Check user stats
docker exec protega-db psql -U protega -d protega -c "
  SELECT 
    COUNT(DISTINCT u.id) as total_users,
    COUNT(pm.id) as total_cards,
    ROUND(COUNT(pm.id)::numeric / COUNT(DISTINCT u.id), 2) as cards_per_user
  FROM users u
  LEFT JOIN payment_methods pm ON pm.user_id = u.id;
"
