# 🎉 Protega CloudPay - PRODUCTION READY!

**Revenue-Generating Cloud Deployment**

## 💰 REVENUE TRACKING

### In Every Transaction

**Transaction record includes:**
```sql
amount_cents:         2000  -- Merchant's amount ($20.00)
protega_fee_cents:    35    -- Protega's revenue ($0.35)
```

**Stripe metadata shows:**
```json
{
  "base_amount_cents": "2000",
  "protega_fee_cents": "35",
  "protega_revenue_model": "0.25% + $0.30"
}
```

### Calculate Total Revenue

**Via Database:**
```sql
SELECT 
  SUM(protega_fee_cents) / 100.0 as total_protega_revenue_usd
FROM transactions
WHERE status = 'SUCCEEDED';
```

**Via Stripe Dashboard:**
- Export payments to CSV
- Sum metadata `protega_fee_cents` column

## 🧪 TESTING

### Local Testing (Current)

```bash
# 1. Start services
docker-compose up

# 2. Test payment

  -d '{
    "terminal_api_key": "your-key",
    "fingerprint_sample": "DEMO-FINGER-001",
    "amount_cents": 2000
  }'

# 3. Verify response shows:
# - Amount: $20.00
# - Protega Fee: $0.35
# - Total Charged: $20.35
```

### Production Testing (After Deploy)

```bash
# Replace localhost:8000 with your Railway URL
curl https://your-api.up.railway.app/

# Test full flow via frontend
https://your-app.vercel.app
```
