# üöÄ Vercel Clean Setup for Protega

## Issue
The deployment was linked to the wrong Vercel account (mypcpclinic). Protega needs its own separate Vercel account and project.

---

## ‚úÖ Solution: Fresh Vercel Setup

### Step 1: Verify You're Logged Into Correct Account

```bash
cd /Users/mjrodriguez/Desktop/Protega/frontend
vercel whoami
```

**Expected output:**
```
> protegacloudpay
```

**If you see a different account:**
```bash
vercel logout
vercel login
# Enter protegacloudpay email when prompted
```

---

### Step 2: Create New Vercel Project (Clean Slate)

```bash
cd /Users/mjrodriguez/Desktop/Protega/frontend
vercel --prod --yes
```

**During setup, answer:**
- **Set up and deploy?** ‚Üí `Y`
- **Which scope?** ‚Üí Select `protegacloudpay` (your Protega account)
- **Link to existing project?** ‚Üí `N` (create new)
- **What's your project's name?** ‚Üí `protega-cloudpay`
- **In which directory?** ‚Üí `.` (current directory)
- **Want to override settings?** ‚Üí `N` (use defaults)

---

### Step 3: Verify Deployment

After deployment completes, you should see:
```
‚úÖ Production: https://protega-cloudpay.vercel.app
```

**Or:**
```
‚úÖ Production: https://protega-cloudpay-protegacloudpay.vercel.app
```

**No more "mypcp" or "mypcpclinic" in the URL!**

---

## üîê Verify Account Separation

### Check Vercel Dashboard:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Make sure you're signed in as **protegacloudpay**
3. You should see **protega-cloudpay** project
4. **Should NOT see** any mypcpclinic projects

### If you see mypcpclinic projects:
- You're in the wrong account
- Click your profile ‚Üí Switch Account ‚Üí protegacloudpay

---

## üéØ Custom Domain (Optional but Recommended)

Once deployed to the correct account:

### Option 1: Vercel Subdomain
```
protega-cloudpay.vercel.app
```
- Free
- Works immediately
- Professional enough for pilot

### Option 2: Custom Domain (Recommended for Production)
```
app.protegacloudpay.com
```

**Setup:**
1. Buy domain: protegacloudpay.com ($12/year)
2. In Vercel dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
3. Add domain: app.protegacloudpay.com
4. Follow DNS instructions
5. Done!

---

## üîÑ Environment Variables

After deployment, set environment variables in Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/protegacloudpay/protega-cloudpay/settings/environment-variables

2. Add these variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://protega-api.fly.dev
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51Q...
```

**Important:** These are SEPARATE from any other projects!

---

## üì± Update Backend CORS

After you get your new Vercel URL, update backend to allow it:

```bash
# On Fly.io
cd /Users/mjrodriguez/Desktop/Protega/backend
flyctl secrets set FRONTEND_URL=https://protega-cloudpay.vercel.app -a protega-api
```

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After setup, verify:

- [ ] Vercel URL does NOT contain "mypcp" or "mypcpclinic"
- [ ] Vercel dashboard shows only Protega projects
- [ ] You're logged in as protegacloudpay
- [ ] Environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Backend CORS allows new frontend URL
- [ ] Test enrollment page works
- [ ] Test payment flow works

## üö® Common Issues

### Issue 1: Still seeing mypcpclinic in URL

**Solution:**
```bash
cd /Users/mjrodriguez/Desktop/Protega/frontend
rm -rf .vercel
vercel logout
vercel login
# Login with protegacloudpay email
vercel --prod --yes
```

### Issue 2: "Access Required" message

**Solution:**

## üìä Account Structure (Best Practice)

```
Protega Account (protegacloudpay)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ protega-cloudpay (frontend)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Production: protega-cloudpay.vercel.app
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Environment Variables
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
